# [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)
My result 0.78468

Conclusion:
Batch 21 was faulty. SVM stuck in it for hours. Base on data and all randomnes in events on Titanic. Pretidion of survival based on my model is good.
I assume that those who reach 100% of correctnes used whole set to train(and overfit it) or just paste correct answer from whole set.
