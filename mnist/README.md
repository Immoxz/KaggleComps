# [MNIST competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview)
My result of 0.98385

Used data transpose to "original" format 28x28 pixels

Created dummy label of classes.

Created convolutional network with 2 dense layers.


Conclusion:
Fitting before dummie classes was about 10%, after creating dummies it level up to 99%. I hope i did not overfit model with so big hidden layers.
